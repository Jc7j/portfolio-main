# Question Driven Development: The Path to Deeper Understanding in Coding and Life

In the world of software development, there are various methodologies and practices, each offering a roadmap to efficient and effective project completion. A less conventional but profoundly impactful approach is Question Driven Development (QDD). QDD is a mindset that I began to develop when I switched my career from medicine to software engineering, and it has helped me through the toughest challenges I have faced.

## What is Question Driven Development?

Question Driven Development is a methodology that revolves around the principle of inquisitiveness. It advocates for a development process where every decision, implementation, and design is approached with a question: Why is this necessary? How does it work? What purpose does it serve? By ensuring that I answer these questions, it makes every element of a project, task, or challenge intentional and justified, and also deepens my understanding of the topic. I've also come to notice that as I answer these questions, I am moving towards a step of discomfort. Discomfort is what helps us grow into more knowledgeable individuals. Yes, it is tough learning how to solve algorithm questions, and it's a daunting task at first, but once you overcome that discomfort from trying to learn, it gets easier. The easier part is what I always look forward to and strive for. As I continue to lay a foundation of knowledge by battling the discomfort and learning every day, the growth becomes exponential, and I get to see how this growth accumulates over time.

## Practical Applications of QDD

- **Code Review & Debugging**: During code reviews, rather than simply checking for syntax and logic errors, delve into the reasons behind coding decisions. Ask about the choice of algorithms, data structures, and design patterns.

- **Learning New Technologies**: When learning a new language or framework, I go beyond the tutorials. Questioning how the underlying mechanisms work and why certain practices are recommended helps solidify my understanding.

## Conclusion

Question Driven Development is more than a development methodology; it's a mindset that values curiosity and understanding above all else. By applying a questioning approach to both coding and life, we can uncover deeper insights, foster innovation, and achieve a more profound comprehension of the complex world in which we live and work.

Embrace the questions. Let them guide your development process, and watch as your projects—and your understanding—reach new heights.
